# Guided Tour ðŸ¥¾

This document provides a guided tour of Alsek. <br>
Please feel free to feed the functions. ðŸ™‚

## Backends

Alsek currently provides 'out of the box' support for [`Redis`](https://redis.io).

#### Redis

```python
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend

# Note: by default, `RedisBackend()` will attempt to 
# connect to an instance of Redis running on localhost.
backend = RedisBackend()
```

### Lazy Initialization

The `RedisBackend` supports lazy initialization.
In this mode, an attempt to establish a connection with the database will be 
deferred until the first time it is absolutely needed (e.g., for a `SET`, `GET`, 
`DELETE`, etc.). This can be useful in applications such as REST APIs where the 
backend may not be available precisely when the application boots up. A small example 
of this mode is provided below.

```python
from redis import Redis
from alsek.storage.backends.abstract import LazyClient
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend

# Initialize the backend with LazyClient
lazy_backend = RedisBackend(LazyClient(lambda: Redis()))

# Run an operation. 
# This will cause LazyClient to evaluate the
# lambda and return a usable client connection.
lazy_backend.count("queues:math_ops")
```

### Namespaces

Backends store all of their data in a predefined _namespace_.
This is simply a prefix that will be prepended to all "keys" (names) 
the backend writes to storage.

## Serializers

Prior to being written into the backend, Alsek requires that data is
first serialized. When data is read from the backend, it is deserialized
prior to use.

By default, Alsek uses JSON serialization, as implemented in 
`alsek.storage.serialization.JsonSerializer()`. However, another 
approach can be used, provided it is supported by the backend.
To use a different serialization procedure, one must:

  * create a new from serializer on top of the base `Serializer()` and 

  * pass the new serializer to the relevant backend at initialization time.

## Messages

Messages are the "lingua franca" of Alsek. This is because the data they 
contain can be "understood" by all parts of the library from brokers and 
result stores, to tasks and worker pools.

### Properties

Messages have a lot of helpful functionality, the most
notable of which is explored here.

```python
from alsek import Broker, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis.standard import RedisBackend

broker = Broker(RedisBackend())

@task(broker)
def simple_task() -> int:
    return 99

message = simple_task.generate()
```

First, let's print the message:

```python
from alsek import Message

Message(
    task_name='simple_task',
    queue='alsek_queue',
    args=(),
    kwargs={},
    metadata=None,
    exception_details=None,
    result_ttl=None,
    uuid='67de0e4c-9816-11eb-8cb0-acde48001122',
    progenitor_uuid=None,
    retries=0,
    timeout=3600000,
    created_at='2021-04-08 05:59:16.424000',
    updated_at='2021-04-08 05:59:16.424000',
    delay=0,
    previous_result=None,
    previous_message_uuid=None,
    callback_message_data=None,
    backoff_settings={'algorithm': 'ExponentialBackoff', 'parameters': {'base': 4, 'factor': 10000, 'floor': 60000, 'ceiling': 3600000, 'zero_override': True}},
    mechanism='thread',
)
```

Next, we can take a quick look at the key properties of the `message`
object.

```python
# Dictionary containing all of the data that can be,
# and will be, persisted to the backend by the broker.
message.data
# Output: {'task_name': 'simple_task', ...}

# High-level summary of the message
message.summary
# Output: Message(uuid='67de0e4c-9816-11eb-8cb0-acde48001122', queue='alsek_queue', task='simple_task')

# UTC Timestamp for when the message will next be ready for processing 
message.ready_at
# Output: 1617861556424

# Time until the message is ready for processing
message.ttr
# Output: 0

# UUIDs which have descended or will descend from this message
message.descendant_uuids
# Output: None

# Whether the message is ready for processing
message.ready
# Output: True
```

## Brokers

A message broker is responsible for adding and managing tasks on the backend.
In Alsek, the `Broker` class provides the following main methods:

  * `exists()`: whether a message exists on the backend
  * `sumbit()`: submit a message to a queue
  * `retry()`: retry a message on a queue
  * `remove()`: remove a message from the backend
  * `fail()`: remove a message, and move it to the Dead Letter Queue (DQL), if enabled

Notably, `Broker` also exposes:

 * `ack()`: acknowledge the message. (This is a convenience method and is 
    functionally the same as `remove()`.)

## Tasks

In this section we will take a closer look at the capabilities of Alsek tasks.

!!! note
    The original behaviour of a function is conserved after it has been
    decorated with `task`. This is illustrated in the example below.

    ```python
    from alsek import task
    
    @task(...)
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b

    assert add(1, b=1) == 2  # True
    ```

### Mechanisms

Tasks can be executed on a _Worker Pool_ using either a `'thread'` or `'process'` mechanism.
We can specify which mechanism the worker pool should use when we construct the task.

```python
from alsek import task

@task(..., mechanism="thread")
def my_task() -> int:
    return 99
```

While the default mechanism is `'process'`, threads can be used in cases where 
lower overhead is desirable, or the task in question is largely I/O bound.  

!!! danger
    Many implementations of Python use a [Global Interpreter Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)
    (GIL), including the most common one: [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython). In such implementations, 
    only one thread can do work at any one time within any given Python process. As a consequence, using 
    `mechanism="thread"` carries the risk of interfering with the threads used by the _Worker Pool_ itself (see below). 
    In the worst case, a task specified with `mechanism="thread"` may never relinquish the GIL and, as a result, the 
    process in which that thread will cease to function (along with any other tasks running in threads in that process).

    While this problem is relatively uncommon in practice, it is an important risk 
    to keep in mind when building your application.

### Timeouts

All Alsek tasks must include a `timeout` (in milliseconds), which is used to 
safeguard against hanging tasks. The default timeout is 3,600,000 milliseconds (1 hour).

Tasks which exceed their timeout will be shutdown by the worker
pool. If a task is eligible to be retried (see below) against a `TimeoutError`,
it will be. Otherwise, the corresponding message will be failed and deleted.

```python
from alsek import task

@task(..., timeout=90 * 1000)  # lower timeout to 90 seconds
def my_task() -> int:
    return 99
```

!!! warning
    Enforcement of timeouts for tasks which use `mechanism='thread'` is only available
    for [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython) (see below).

!!! warning
    Timeout enforcement for tasks which use `mechanism='thread'` is not as reliable as it
    is for tasks which use `mechanism='process'`. This is because Alsek effectuates timeouts in 
    thread tasks by asynchronously setting a `TimeoutError` inside them. In order for this error 
    to be raised, the thread in question must first acquire the GIL (see above). If the thread
    never acquires the GIL, the error will _never_ be raised. Conversely, Alsek implements timeouts
    for process tasks by directly terminating them, which is generally extremely reliable. The reasons
    for this dichotomy are beyond Alsek's control and stem from the implementation details of CPython
    itself.

    As above, while this problem is relatively uncommon in practice, it is an important risk 
    to keep in mind when building your application.

### Priority

As with timeouts, priority values can be set for each message.

Let's take a look at an example.

```python
from alsek import task

@task(..., queue="my_queue")
def task_a() -> str:
    return "A!"

message_1 = task_a.generate(priority=1)
message_2 = task_a.generate(priority=0)
```

In Alsek, `priority` is inverted. That is, lower integers correspond to higher priority.
Thus, in the example above, `message_2` will take priority over `message_1`.

!!! note
    Alsek implements _intra-queue_ message priority. In other words, priority 
    is enforced within, but not between, queues (which themselves can be prioritized).

### Triggers

Alsek supports cron, date as well as interval triggers. Let's explore this using the example below.

```python
from alsek import Broker, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis.standard import RedisBackend
from apscheduler.triggers.interval import IntervalTrigger

broker = Broker(RedisBackend())

@task(broker, trigger=IntervalTrigger(hours=1))
def check_system_usage() -> int:
    return 99
```

The result will be a special of a type: `TriggerTask`.
Like `Task`, we can generate an instance of the task by
calling `generate()`.

```python
message = check_system_usage.generate()
```

The task will now be submitted to the broker every hour for as long 
as the Python process in which it was created is alive.

There are three main ways we can interrupt these kinds of tasks.

First, we can pause the scheduler:

```python
check_resource_usage.pause()
```

(Note that this can be undone by running `check_resource_usage.resume()`.)

Second, we can clear the scheduled task:

```python
check_resource_usage.clear()
```

Finally, we can shut down the underlying scheduler:

```python
check_resource_usage.shutdown()
```

!!! warning
    Function parameters are not permitted for tasks which use a trigger.

### Message Passing

The message itself will be passed to `task`s which include a `message` parameter. 

```python
from alsek import Broker, Message, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis.standard import RedisBackend

broker = Broker(RedisBackend())

@task(broker)
def my_task(message: Message) -> None:  # note: type hints are optional
    print(message.uuid)
```

!!! warning
    The message will not be passed to the task if:

       * a "message" key is included in `kwargs`, e.g., `my_task.generate(kwargs={"message": "string"})`
       * a type hint that does not resolve to `Message` is used for `message`.

### Callbacks

When a task completes, another task can be automatically triggered through
the use of a _callback_.

To see this, let's contrive two simple tasks: `add_1()` and `print_result()`:

```python
from alsek import Broker, Message, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis.standard import RedisBackend

broker = Broker(RedisBackend())

@task(broker)
def add_1(number: int) -> int:
    return number + 1

@task(broker)
def print_result(message: Message) -> None:
    print(message.previous_result)
```

In order to make `print_result()` execute when `add_1()`
completes, we simply need to pass a generated message to `callback`.
It's also advisable to set `submit=False` so that submission to the broker is 
deferred until _after_ the first message completes.

```python
add_1.generate(
    args=(1,),
    callback=print_result.generate(submit=False)
)
```

As a convenience, we can also use _deferred mode_, which instructs
the next call of `generate()` to skip submitting the message to
the broker.

```python
add_1.generate(
    args=(1,),
    callback=print_result.defer().generate()
)
```

#### Nested

Callbacks of arbitrary depth are also supported.

To see this, let's add another task into the mix.

```python
@task(broker)
def add_1_previous(message: Message) -> int:
    return message.previous_result + 1
```

```python
add_1.generate(
    args=(1,),
    callback=(
        add_1_previous.defer().generate(
            callback=add_1_previous.defer().generate(
                callback=add_1_previous.defer().generate(
                    callback=print_result.defer().generate()
                )
            ),
        )
    ),
)
```

While the code above will "work", it is very difficult to read. 
A better solution is to use a `tuple` of messages.

```python
add_1.generate(
    args=(1,),
    callback=(
        add_1_previous.defer().generate(),
        add_1_previous.defer().generate(),
        add_1_previous.defer().generate(),
        print_result.defer().generate()
    ),
)
```

Internally, a message nesting procedure will be run against the tuple passed to `callback`.
As a result, the two different approaches to multiple callbacks shown above are functionally 
_identical_.

!!! note
    The internal process described above for nesting a flat
    tuple of callbacks will update the `callback_message_data` 
    fields in the original messages.

!!! note
    Deferred mode is automatically cancelled by ``generate()``
    prior to it returning.

!!! note
    The progenitor for a callback message is considered to be the root callback.  

!!! warning
    Each callback message's `previous_result` and `progenitor_uuid` fields 
    will be set on the worker pool after successful execution of the 
    previous message, and are not available prior to this.

!!! danger
    While it is valid for a task with a trigger to have callbacks,
    callbacks should not include tasks with triggers.

#### Control

If a callback is present for a message it will be executed by default.
However, it is possible to override this behaviour by reasoning about
the original message itself, the result of the task or both. 

```python
from typing import Any

from alsek import Message
from alsek.core.task import Task, task

class CustomTask1(Task):
    def do_callback(self, message: Message, result: Any) -> bool:
        if result > 1:
            return True
        else:
            return False

@task(..., base_task=CustomTask1)
def simple_task() -> int:
    return 99
```

!!! warning
    The `do_callback()` method is only evaluated for messages which contain a callback.

### Pre/Post Ops

The `pre_op()` and `post_op()` methods of `Task` can be used to 
perform operations before and/or after the `function` itself executes, respectively.
To do this, a new `base_task` must be created.

```python
from alsek import Message
from alsek.core.task import Task, task

class CustomTask2(Task):
    def pre_op(self, message: Message) -> None:
        print(f"About to process {message.summary}!")
        
    def post_op(self, message: Message, result: Any) -> None:
        print(f"Processed {message.summary} and got '{result}'!")


@task(..., base_task=CustomTask2)
def simple_task() -> int:
    return 99
```

### Retries

The number of times a task will be retried is determined by
`max_retries` by default. In cases where this is not sufficiently 
sophisticated to determine if message should be retried, the `do_retry()` 
method of the `Task` class can be overridden.

```python
from alsek import Message
from alsek.core.task import Task, task

class CustomTask3(Task):
    def do_retry(self, message: Message, exception: BaseException) -> bool:
        if isinstance(exception, ZeroDivisionError):
            return False
        elif self.max_retries is None:
            return True
        else:
            return message.retries < self.max_retries

@task(..., base_task=CustomTask3)
def simple_task() -> int:
    return 99
```

### Backoff

Rather than reprocessing a task immediately after it fails,
Alsek uses a backoff procedure. By default, `ExponentialBackoff()` 
is used with "sensible" defaults. However, the type of backoff algorithm 
as well as its parameters are extremely customizable. 

```python
from alsek import task
from alsek.core.backoff import (
    ConstantBackoff, 
    ExponentialBackoff,
    LinearBackoff, 
)

@task(..., backoff=ConstantBackoff(constant=30 * 1000))
def task_a() -> int:
    return 99

@task(..., backoff=LinearBackoff(factor=30 * 1000))
def task_b() -> int:
    return 99

@task(..., backoff=ExponentialBackoff(ceiling=90 * 1000))
def task_c() -> int:
    return 99
```

!!! note
    Backoff duration is determined by the number of 'incidents'.
    Here, an incident is a failed attempt to process the message.

!!! note
    Setting `backoff=None` is functionally equivalent to 
    ``ConstantBackoff(constant=0, floor=0, ceiling=0, zero_override=True)``.


## Status Tracking

The status of tasks can be tracked using `StatusTracker()`.

```python
from alsek import Broker, StatusTracker, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend

backend = RedisBackend("<connection_url>")

broker = Broker(backend)
status_tracker = StatusTracker(backend)

@task(broker, status_tracker=status_tracker)
def sum_n(n: int) -> int:
    return int(n * (n + 1) / 2)

message = sum_n.generate(kwargs={"n": 100})
```

The status can be checked using `.get()`:

```python
status_tracker.get(message)
```

and can be any one of the following:

  * `<TaskStatus.UNKNOWN: 0>`
  * `<TaskStatus.SUBMITTED: 1>`
  * `<TaskStatus.RUNNING: 2>`
  * `<TaskStatus.RETRYING: 3>`
  * `<TaskStatus.FAILED: 4>`
  * `<TaskStatus.SUCCEEDED: 5>`

!!! note
    `StatusTracker()` can be paired with `StatusTrackerIntegryScanner()`, which
    will periodically scan for message statuses which have become invalid. Specifically, 
    a scan will be performed to check for messages with statuses which are non-terminal (i.e., not 
    ``TaskStatus.FAILED`` or ``TaskStatus.SUCCEEDED``) and no longer exist
    in the broker. Any messages meeting these criteria will have their status
    updated to ``TaskStatus.UNKNOWN``.  Status information can become corrupt in 
    this way in cases where a worker pool is unable to update the message status 
    before exiting (i.e., in the event of an ungraceful shutdown) and the message
    is never subsequently retried.

    The frequency of status integrity scans can be changed by altering the
    ``trigger`` parameter of `StatusTrackerIntegryScanner()`..

## Result Storage

Task results can be persisted to a `backend` using `ResultStore()`. 

```python
from typing import Dict

from alsek import Broker, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend
from alsek.storage.result import ResultStore

backend = RedisBackend("<connection_url>")

broker = Broker(backend)
result_store = ResultStore(backend)

@task(broker, result_store=result_store)
def valuable_output() -> Dict[str, int]:
    return {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
```

!!! warning
    In order for data to be persisted via `result_store`, it must be
    of a type supported by the `backend`'s `serializer`.

!!! warning
    By default, results are automatically deleted once they are fetched. 
    To disable this behavior, set `keep=True` when invoking ``get()``.

### Triggers & Result Storage

We can request result storage for tasks with triggers, just as we did with a standard task above. 
However, fetching the results of a task requires us to know its `uuid`. While it is possible
to collect this information (e.g., via `pre_op()` or `post_op()`), it is often far easier to 
simply store the _progenitor_ message or, at the least, its `uuid`. With this information, 
we can obtain all _descendant_ messages.

```python
from random import randint
from apscheduler.triggers.interval import IntervalTrigger

from alsek import Broker, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis.standard import RedisBackend
from alsek.storage.result import ResultStore

backend = RedisBackend()
broker = Broker(backend)
result_storage = ResultStore(backend)


@task(broker, result_store=result_storage, trigger=IntervalTrigger(seconds=10))
def harvest_data() -> int:
    data = randint(0, 100)
    return data

# Start 
message = harvest_data.generate()

# Get all of the results as a list. By setting `descendants=True` we
# will also data for any descendant messages which have completed.
results = result_storage.get(message, timeout=30 * 1000, descendants=True)

print(results)
# [3, 5, 88, ...]
```

!!! note
    Metadata for each result can be included by specifying ``with_metadata=True``.

!!! warning
    The order of results when ``descendants=True`` is determined by the 
    time at which the data was written to the backend, not when the corresponding task 
    completed. While this difference is usually very small, if this is
    not appropriate for your application, you must include timestamp information 
    in the output of the task function and re-sort the results accordingly.

### Result Iteration

The `ResultPool()` class provides an intuitive means of iterating over 
stored results. To see how, we can define a task, just as we have done 
several times before, and create an instance of the `ResultPool()` class.

```python
from alsek import Broker, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend
from alsek.storage.result import ResultStore
from alsek.tools import ResultPool

backend = RedisBackend("<connection_url>")

broker = Broker(backend)
result_store = ResultStore(backend)
result_pool = ResultPool(result_store)

@task(broker, result_store=result_store)
def sum_n(n: int) -> int:
    return int(n * (n + 1) / 2)
```

From here we can use the `istream()` method of `result_pool` to 
iterate over message results as they become available.

```python
for message, result in result_pool.istream(
    sum_n.generate(kwargs=dict(n=10)),
    sum_n.generate(kwargs=dict(n=100)),
    sum_n.generate(kwargs=dict(n=1000)),
    descendants=False,  # enable if any messages contain callbacks
):
    print(f"The result of message '{message.uuid}' is {result}.")
```

Result pools can be used in applications, or for interactive distributed computing.

!!! note
    If your use case requires a guarantee that results will be yielded 
    in the same order in which the messages were provided, use the ``stream()`` 
    method instead.

## Concurrency

Alsek's concurrency `Lock()` provides a straightforward way limit 
simultaneity across a distributed application to a single task, as shown here:

```python
from alsek import Lock, task
from alsek.storage.backends.redis.standard import RedisBackend

backend = RedisBackend()

@task(...)
def send_data() -> None:
    with Lock("send_data", backend=backend) as lock:
        if lock.acquire(strict=False):
            print("Sending data...")
        else:
            print("Failed to acquire lock")
```

## Consumers

As their name suggests, consumers pull messages inserted by the broker
onto workers. A concurrency lock (similar to what is shown above) is
used to ensure than one, and only one, consumer can hold a message
at any given time.

Standard use of Alsek does not typically entail direct interaction with consumers,
as they are managed by _Worker Pools_ (see below). However, in the interest 
of completeness, an illustrative example of working with consumers is provided below.

```python
from alsek import Broker
from alsek.core.consumer import Consumer
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend

broker = Broker(RedisBackend())
consumer = Consumer(broker)

for message in consumer.stream():
    print(f"Got {message.summary}")
```

!!! note
    Consumers backoff following one or more passes over the backend that 
    do not yield any ready messages. By default, `LinearBackoff()` is used.


## Worker Pools

Alsek provides two distinct worker pool implementations for processing tasks: `ThreadWorkerPool` and `ProcessWorkerPool`. Each offers different performance characteristics and scaling capabilities.

### Thread Worker Pool

The `ThreadWorkerPool` uses a hierarchical architecture with process groups that each manage multiple threads:

```python
from alsek import Broker
from alsek.core.worker.thread import ThreadWorkerPool
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend

backend = RedisBackend()
broker = Broker(backend)

pool = ThreadWorkerPool(
    tasks=[task_a, task_b],  # tasks to process
    n_threads=8,             # threads per process group
    n_processes=4,           # maximum number of process groups
)
pool.run()
```

Key features of the `ThreadWorkerPool`:

* **Elastic Scaling**: Automatically creates new process groups as needed and prunes them when they're no longer required
* **Hierarchical Design**: Each process group manages its own set of threads
* **Total Capacity**: The maximum number of concurrent tasks is `n_threads Ã— n_processes`
* **Resource Efficiency**: Ideal for I/O-bound tasks or when lower overhead is desired

The `ThreadWorkerPool` will dynamically scale up to `n_processes` process groups, each managing up to `n_threads` threads, for a maximum capacity of `n_threads Ã— n_processes`. When a message needs to be processed, it is assigned to an available process group, which then executes it on one of its threads.

### Process Worker Pool

The `ProcessWorkerPool` uses a direct approach where each task runs in its own dedicated process:

```python
from alsek import Broker
from alsek.core.worker.process import ProcessWorkerPool
from alsek.storage.backends.redis import RedisBackend

backend = RedisBackend()
broker = Broker(backend)

pool = ProcessWorkerPool(
    tasks=[task_a, task_b],  # tasks to process
    n_processes=4,           # maximum number of processes
    prune_interval=100,      # milliseconds between prune scans
)
pool.run()
```

Key features of the `ProcessWorkerPool`:

* **Process Isolation**: Each task runs in its own dedicated process
* **Fixed Capacity**: Limited to a maximum of `n_processes` concurrent tasks
* **Background Pruning**: Uses a background scheduler to periodically prune spent futures
* **Resource Safety**: Ideal for CPU-bound tasks or when process isolation is necessary

The `ProcessWorkerPool` will execute each task in its own dedicated process, up to the maximum of `n_processes` concurrent processes. This offers stronger isolation between tasks but with slightly higher overhead compared to threads.

### Performance Considerations

When choosing between worker pool types, consider:

1. **I/O vs CPU Bound Tasks**: For I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests, database operations), `ThreadWorkerPool` often offers better performance. For CPU-bound tasks, `ProcessWorkerPool` can better utilize multiple cores.

2. **Memory Usage**: `ThreadWorkerPool` is typically more memory-efficient as threads share memory within their process group.

3. **Isolation Needs**: If tasks need strong isolation from each other, `ProcessWorkerPool` provides better separation.

4. **Elasticity**: If your workload has variable demand, `ThreadWorkerPool`'s elastic scaling may be more efficient.

5. **Shutdown Reliability**: `ProcessWorkerPool` offers more robust shutdown logic since it can directly terminate processes, avoiding potential GIL-related issues where a thread might never relinquish control and prevent proper shutdown (see above).

!!! note
    Both worker pool types use timeouts to manage hanging tasks and provide similar retry and backoff capabilities.

!!! warning
    For tasks using `mechanism='thread'`, be aware of Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which can limit true parallelism within a single process group.

## CLI

Alsek's command line interface (CLI) provides an easy way to bring a pool of
workers online to process tasks for which we can provide the definition. 

Alsek offers two types of worker pools:

* `thread-pool`: Uses a hierarchical architecture with process groups that each manage multiple threads
* `process-pool`: Uses a direct approach where each task runs in its own process

Each worker pool relies on a `Consumer` to pull messages written to the backend by the `Broker`. 
When the worker pool reaches capacity, it will pause the stream of data from the consumer. 
This is done to both reduce load on the backend and to allow other worker pools (perhaps 
running on different machines) to acquire messages for processing.

### Basics

The CLI requires that we inform it where tasks can be found.

To start with a simple case, let's imagine our one and only task
is located in the current working directory in a file titled `my_task.py`. 

Then, starting a worker pool against this task can be accomplished by running:

```shell
# For a process-based worker pool
alsek process-pool my_tasks

# For a thread-based worker pool
alsek thread-pool my_tasks
```

#### Nested files

Alternatively, we might have a file of task definitions inside a directory, like this:

```
my_project
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ singletons.py
    â””â”€â”€ my_tasks.py
```

Starting a pool with this kind of structure can be accomplished by passing
the dot-separated "path" to the file: 

```shell
alsek process-pool my_project.my_tasks
```

#### Recursive

We can also simply specify the directory where the task definitions live, 
and it will be scanned recursively in order to recover _all_ task definitions.

```shell
alsek thread-pool my_project
```

### Advanced options

Alsek's CLI includes several dials to achieve fine-grain control over the worker pool.
We won't cover all of them here, but there are at least a few worth highlighting.

#### Queue Selection

The `-qu`/`--queues` option allows you to limit the queues which will be consumed by the worker pool. 
It can be set using a comma-separated list.

```shell
alsek process-pool my_project -qu queue_a
```

```shell
alsek thread-pool my_project -qu queue_a,queue_b,queue_z
```

#### Worker Capacity

##### Thread-based Worker Pools

For thread-based worker pools, you can control both the number of threads per process group and 
the maximum number of process groups:

```shell
# Configure 8 threads per process group
alsek thread-pool my_project --n_threads 8

# Configure a maximum of 4 process groups
alsek thread-pool my_project --n_processes 4
```

The total maximum capacity of a thread-based worker pool is `n_threads Ã— n_processes`.

Thread pools support elastic scaling, automatically creating new process groups up to the configured maximum
as needed, and pruning them when no longer needed.

##### Process-based Worker Pools

For process-based worker pools, you can control the maximum number of concurrent processes:

```shell
# Configure a maximum of 4 processes
alsek process-pool my_project --n_processes 4
```

#### Performance Tuning

Both worker pool types support additional performance tuning options:

```shell
# Configure slot wait interval (milliseconds to wait when pool is full)
alsek thread-pool my_project --slot_wait_interval 50

# For process-based worker pools, configure prune interval
alsek process-pool my_project --prune_interval 100

# For thread-based worker pools, wait for thread exit to mark as complete
alsek thread-pool my_project --complete_only_on_thread_exit
```

!!! note
    The worker pool's `Consumer` will respect the order in which queues
    are listed for the `-qu`/`--queues` option. If, this option is not specified, 
    queues will be consumed in alphabetical order.

!!! note
    Worker pools scale up and down dynamically based on load.

!!! note
    The full documentation for Alsek's CLI can be obtained by
    running:

    ```shell
    alsek --help
    ```

!!! warning
    If a worker pool encounters a message which refers to an unknown 
    task, an error will be logged and the message will be failed.
